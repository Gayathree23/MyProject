NZTA Vehicle for family 
 
The brief Requirement:

I am a buyer for a large second hand car dealership. I want to make some decisions about what cars I might like to buy for our car yard.
Our car yard prides itself on providing good quality, affordable and reliable used cars for New Zealand families. 

I would like you to create a dashboard that supports me for buying vehicles for our yard based on this data set in the first instance. 

 You can also provide recommendations/commentary based on the insight you have derived.
